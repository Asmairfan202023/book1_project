# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy and Verifiability
Content must be based on primary, verifiable sources. All factual claims must be source-verified.

### II. Clarity and Accessibility
Writing must be clear and accessible to academic readers with a Computer Science background. The target reading level is Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10–12.

### III. Reproducibility and Rigor
The work must be based on peer-reviewed research to ensure academic rigor. All citations must be traceable, following the APA citation style.

### IV. Sourcing and Plagiarism
A minimum of 15 sources must be used, with at least 50% being peer-reviewed. There is a zero-tolerance policy for plagiarism.

### V. Consistency
Concepts from the prior book on AI Agents must be integrated. Terminology and definitions must be consistent throughout the textbook.

## Project Constraints
